Serverless computing is an environment hosted in the cloud that allows you to run code 

these events could be rest end points, periodic times or even messages that 
are received from another Azure service 
and what's cool about it is that your serverless app only runs when it's triggered by an event which 
means cost saveings, scaling and performance are also handled automatically, which means that you only 
pay for the resources that you use 

Over the next few minutes, we're going to take a look at some of the more common Serverless service 
Types in Azure 

these Serverless service types include Azure functions as your logic apps and Azure event grid 

Azure Functions 
is code running your service and not the underlying platform or infrastructure.

Azure Functions is code running yout service and not the underlying platform or infrastructure.
-A perfect solution when demand is variable.
-Azure functions are stateless 
-Azure functions can be connected to an Azure storage service. 

 Azure Logic Apps 
 -is a cloud service that helps you automate and orchestrate tasks, business processes, and workflows
 when you need to integrate apps, data, systems, and services 
 -Simplifies the design and build-out of scalable solutions 
 -Designed in a web-based designer 
 -Over 200 different connectors available to help build enterprise integration solutions with Azure Logic Apps 
 there connectors include services like Salesforce, SAP, Orecle DB and file shares 
 
 Azure Event Grid 
 -is a fully-managed, intelligent event routing service that uses a publish-subscribe model 
for uniform event consumption 
-Built-in support for events coming from Azure services, like storage blobs and resource groups
-Supports custom nan-Azure-based events in near-real time via custom topics
