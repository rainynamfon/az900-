fault tolerance 
is the ability of a service to remain available after a failure of one of the components of the service. for example,a service eunning on mutiple servers can 
withstand the failure of one of the servers.

Disaster revovery 
is the recovery of a service after a failure. for example, restoring a virtual machine from backup after a virtual machine failure.

Dynamic scalability
is the ability for compute resource to be added to a service when the service is under heavy load. for example, in a virtual machine scale set,
additional instances of the virtual machine are added when the existing vistual machine are under heavy load 

low latency 
is the the time a service to respond to requests. for example , the time it takes for a web page to be returned from a web server. low latency means low response
time which means a quicker response
